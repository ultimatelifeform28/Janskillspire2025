// console.log(pushFront([2,3.4.5],1))

//Array: Pop Front Given array, remove and return the value at the beginning of the array.
//  Do this without using any built-in array methods except pop() for JS. 
// Don't use pop(index) (with param use pop without param) or del for python,
//  this would create a one line solution. Given [1,2,3,4,5] return 1 and your array
//  should look like this [2,3,4,5]
