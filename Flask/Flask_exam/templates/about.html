    <h1>About Flask</h1>
    <p>Flask is a micro web framework written in Python.
         It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.
          It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.</p>
